<<<<<<< HEAD
BigMatch is a record linkage software that was developed for the US Census Bureau.  BigMatch is a matching engine without a graphical user interface (GUI).  It executes based on two parameter files, conventionally named parmf.txt and parmn.txt. After execution, the user must manually open the results files (possible matches and weights) and decide which possible matches to accept.  

The purpose of the bigmatch_utilities code repository is to provide a code base for GUI and shell script tools to make BigMatch more user-friendly and less error prone.
